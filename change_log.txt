templateSD - version 0.0 - thomas (28-09-2020)
	- used to retrain monkeys
	- clampeye disabled to check raw traces
	- no fixation maintenance after fix acquire
	- all eyejoytracks (other than for monkey choice) store rt

templateSD - version 0.1 - thomas (12-10-2020)
	- corrected all rt's from eyejoytrack into time from trial start
	- incorporated a fixation maintenance period after fix acquire
	- removed any clampEye codes (will add later if needed)
	- still using legacy PsychtoolBox serialport funcs
	- copied cfg file from generalSDV_0.0 as that is latest

mlLib   - version 1.0 - thomas/georgin (15-10-2020)

	- ml_initExp: asks if netcam auto record is needed.
	- ml_startNetcamRecord, ml_stopNetcamRecord: requires watchtower to be on and cameras bound
	  starts and stops netcam record remotely and makes appropriate folder to save files in (E:\series4\expFolder\monkeyFolder\*.mp4)
	- ml_packHeader: corrected wrong variable name issue
	- ml_sendHeader: send bhv file name also	
	- ml_alert_function: updated to close serial port correctly on exp end (but any error in ML task requires MATLAB restart)
	- ml_loadEvents: added codes for bhvName start and stop
	- ml_makeConditionSD: increased fixation point size to 0.6dva from 0.3dva


templateSD - version 1.0 - thomas/georgin (15-10-2020)

	- removed dependency on legacy iscan serial code
	- noe use MATLABs own serialport function (always add default file to top of path as ML also has similarly named function)
	- updated calibration timing file to have cal point acquire time and hodl time as editable vars
	- cleared up timing code text (removed sections and unwanted variables)
	- new eye calib settings as juice spout and touchscreen height increased by ~2.5cm.
	- now there are individual monkeys dqw settings files for iscan also (eg: illumBelowTrackerAbovCoCo20201015.def)

mlLib   - version 2.0 - thomas/georgin (22-10-2020)
	
	- ml_mlconcatenate: modified few lines(commented within) which gave error for touchpoints being NaN
	- ml_loadEvents: added start stop and shift markers for editable variables and changed ascii shift from 10000 to 200000
	- Added descriptions and comments for all functions in lib
	- Removed unneccessary/deprecated functions

templateSD - version 2.0 - thomas/georgin (22-10-2020)

	- packing following editable variable into trial footer using start stop and shift markers (trl.edtStart..etc)
		- goodPause - badPause - fixRadius - fixPeriod - calHoldPeriod - rewardVol (*1000, hence will be in microlitres)
	- added check.linesEven before trl.start and check.linesOdd after trl.stop eventmarkers. Good visual marker on OEP lfp viewer
	- photodiode cue now simply flips state at every visual event in the trial (turned off at beginning and end of trial)
	- photodiode signal is now in analog mode instead of digital due to iffy reliability in digtial mode
	- updated fillDashboard.m to calculate and display errors correctly and differentiate type of error, removed weighted accuracy
	- audio files now located in folder 'aud' instead of ambiguous 'dep'
	- added config files from iscan(DQW settings), oep(Channel config) and ml(cfg2.mat) into folder 'cfg'
