templateSD - version 0.0 - thomas (28-09-2020)
	- used to retrain monkeys
	- clampeye disabled to check raw traces
	- no fixation maintenance after fix acquire
	- all eyejoytracks (other than for monkey choice) store rt

templateSD - version 0.1 - thomas (12-10-2020)
	- corrected all rt's from eyejoytrack into time from trial start
	- incorporated a fixation maintenance period after fix acquire
	- removed any clampEye codes (will add later if needed)
	- still using legacy PsychtoolBox serialport funcs
	- copied cfg file from generalSDV_0.0 as that is latest

mlLib   - version 1.0 - thomas/georgin (15-10-2020)

	- ml_initExp: asks if netcam auto record is needed.
	- ml_startNetcamRecord, ml_stopNetcamRecord: requires watchtower to be on and cameras bound
	  starts and stops netcam record remotely and makes appropriate folder to save files in (E:\series4\expFolder\monkeyFolder\*.mp4)
	- ml_packHeader: corrected wrong variable name issue
	- ml_sendHeader: send bhv file name also	
	- ml_alert_function: updated to close serial port correctly on exp end (but any error in ML task requires MATLAB restart)
	- ml_loadEvents: added codes for bhvName start and stop
	- ml_makeConditionSD: increased fixation point size to 0.6dva from 0.3dva


templateSD - version 1.0 - thomas/georgin (15-10-2020)

	- removed dependency on legacy iscan serial code
	- noe use MATLABs own serialport function (always add default file to top of path as ML also has similarly named function)
	- updated calibration timing file to have cal point acquire time and hodl time as editable vars
	- cleared up timing code text (removed sections and unwanted variables)
	- new eye calib settings as juice spout and touchscreen height increased by ~2.5cm.
	- now there are individual monkeys dqw settings files for iscan also (eg: illumBelowTrackerAbovCoCo20201015.def)
